# 指标

`oasis-node` 可以向 Prometheus 服务器报告一些指标。 默认情况下，不会收集和报告任何指标。 有一种方法可以启用指标报告：

- *拉模式*监听给定地址并等待 Prometheus 抓取指标。

## 配置 oasis-node

要在拉模式下运行 `oasis-node` 设置标志 -`-metrics.mode pull` 并使用 `--metrics.address` 提供侦听地址。 例如

```
oasis-node --metrics.mode pull --metrics.address localhost:3000

```

然后，将以下段添加到您的 prometheus.yml 并重新启动 Prometheus：

```
  - job_name : 'oasis-node'

    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']

```
